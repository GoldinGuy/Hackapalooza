### ü•à Best Beginner Hack: **memebreak**


"memebreak" aims to distract you while you are working, ruin your productivity, and give you much needed breaks in lengthy computer sessions! However, we do respect important meetings and have implemented a system to delay a meme by up to 60 minutes because a meeting longer than that isn't worth going to without memes! Let's talk about the memes, so the memes are sourced from Reddit and are filtered to exclude any Not Safe For Work (NSFW) posts. There is even a never ending next feature where you can get lost in the world of instant gratification!

### ü•â Best Use of Google Cloud: **Discord Live Translator**

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47064842/134825369-1d72ac10-de3b-499f-897a-874abfee175a.png)

My project is a discord translator and language moderator.

In few words, you set up a language that you want to be used in a chanel, so only that language can be spoken there. It checks all the messages and if the language it is not the given one, it translates it and sends it after doing that.

This makes language moderating easy so you are sure that messages will only be sent in one language in their respective channels, this make things so much easier to multi-language comunities.

Our chrome extension ‚ÄúWatch This!‚Äù summons a Jett character to the user‚Äôs screen. She sporadically performs abilities which mess with user‚Äôs webpage. We included a dash which knocks out the text, and planned on making an updraft which scrolls the page up, and a smoke that obscures the vision of the user.
